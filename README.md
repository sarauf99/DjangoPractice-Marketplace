# DjangoPractice-Marketplace

This repo is for the marketplace website project using django. [Learn Django by Building an Online Marketplace â€“ Python Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxMB6Njs3ck&t=212s) by [Freecodecamp](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp) will be used to build the website.

I'm also taking digital notes of things I would want to remember from this project. They're available in the  [notes](notes.md) file.
